# Moonlight Girl, 1950

Hi ma,

Here I'd like to try to explain the prints that I sent to you and Granddad for
Christmas, and attempt to show a little bit of the process that led to them, in
case you're interested!

I'm not sure if you'll recognize the source of the print — it's this old
newspaper story about your mom being crowned Phi Sigma Kappa's "Moonlight Girl"
for 1950:

I took that photo on Feb. 25, 2012.  I think this was when we were sitting in
the living room at your parents' house and looking through all of your mom's
old scrap books.

The prints that you have are are from the third attempt I made at transforming
my photo of the newspaper's photo into something else. As you can probably
guess, they came out of my weekly printmaking class at the [Barnsdall Art
Center][].

## First attempt: indirect drawing

I made the first attempt when we were learning a technique our teacher called
_indirect drawing_, which you can see here:

Here you'll see four prints in various states of completeness. The two on the
right were just initial sketches as I tried to get a feel for the technique.
The two on the left are a pair, where I intentionally made the indirect drawing
a negative in order to try to make the subsequent _ghost print_ the final
product.

> Monotyping produces a unique print, or monotype; most of the ink is removed

> considered inferior. *These prints from the original plate are called "ghost
> prints."*

## Second attempt: linoleum block

I wasn't really satisfied with the indirect drawing results, so I decided to go
back to working with linoleum blocks. I wasn't sure if the material and my own
carving skills would allow for enough detail to capture your mom's beauty in
the original image, so this attempt was really an experiment.

I think it turned out okay, but I wasn't happy with the composition, in which I
had cropped more of the image than was necessary!

## Final attempt: more linoleum block

I went into the final week of class hoping that I'd be able to carve a new
linoleum block with a better composition and have time to make some prints
before I lost access to the studio and all of the printmaking materials.

You now have a couple of the prints from this final session, the results of
which you can see here:

## The blocks

A nice thing about all of this is that I still have the linoleum blocks, so I
can always print more of these.

I regret, for instance, that one of the prints I sent you was made on flimsy
calligraphy paper, which gained some ripples during the framing process. So,
I'd be happy to make another print to replace that one, or to make better
prints of the first linoleum block composition if you prefer it.

Anyway, I hope you like them!

### Love,
### Will.
